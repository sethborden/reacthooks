# React Hooks are awesome
See [this](git@github.com:sethborden/reacthooks.git) talk by the indispensable
[Sophie Alpert](http://www.twitter.com/sophie_bits) and [Dan
Abramov](http://www.twitter.com/danabramov) for a complete overview. The *tl;dr*
is that hooks solve a number of annoyances around state management and shared
state between component.

## Hooks are tiny, let's not `leftpad` this...
The Javascript ecosystem is kinda notorious for blindly importing microscopically
small libraries from NPM to take care of common tasks that our
Python/Ruby/Java/Go brethren get for free from their standard libraries. Google
`leftpad fiasco` to see the impact of this.  Dan Abramov made the excellent
point that it's probably best that we all just keep the tiny hooks in their own
repos.  He's probably right.
